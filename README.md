# Weather Widget <!-- omit in toc -->

A simple weather widget built for a [technical test](https://ffxblue.github.io/interview-tests/test/weather-widget/).

## Todo <!-- omit in toc -->

- Add Error Boundries.
- Make API key private ([see](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-fetching-data/#comment-3964499401)).
- Show night/day icons.
- Deploy to GH Pages.
- Tests.
- Loading placeholder for icon.
- Favicon.
- stylelint.
- Local storage.
- Add a page reload button to `EditorWidget` to give option to refresh location.
- Set focus to relevant element when view loads.

## If I had more time <!-- omit in toc -->

- Use TypeScript.
- Swap out the `.png` icons for custom SVG icons that I'd render inline.
- Add Storybook.
- Fallback for browsers that don't support Geolocation API, use IP Lookup ([see](https://medium.com/@adeyinkaadegbenro/how-to-detect-the-location-of-your-websites-visitor-using-javascript-92f9e91c095f)).

## Going Beyond the Requirements <!-- omit in toc -->

- I added a page title (`<h1>`) as I felt it improved the UX.
